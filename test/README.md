Examples:
--------------------------
This folder contains three different multipliers.

Run './test.sh' to execute all provided test cases.

In all three cases we apply adder substition before verifying the (rewritten) 
multiplier. Log files for AMulet are provided.
To completely verify the multiplier the generated '*.cnf' file needs to be given 
to a SAT solver, e.g. [`CaDiCal`](https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical), which has to yield 'UNSAT'.

In the third example we furthermore generate proof certificates, which can 
be given to our proof checkers [`Pacheck`](http://fmv.jku.at/pacheck_pasteque/)
or [`Pastéque`](http://fmv.jku.at/pacheck_pasteque/).

We provide the following multipliers:


btor64.aig: 
-----------------------------------------------------
This 64-bit multiplier is synthesized with the SMT solver Boolector.
It turns out that these clean multipliers are structurally the
same as those generated by ABC using the 'gen -m' command in the
'abc' directory.


bpwtcl64.aig, s_sparcl64.aig: 
-----------------------------------------------------------
These multipliers were generated and obtained from the service provided at:

Further, these AIGs were synthesized to AIGER circuits with YoSyS/ABC from
their Verilog specification as follows

  yosys -p "hierarchy -auto-top -check" -p flatten -p techmap -p stat -o mult.blif mult.v

which was the same setting as used in the following paper

  Drechsler: Formal verification of integer multipliers by combining Gröbner
  basis with logic reduction. DATE 2016: 1048-1053.

The YoSyS command above was explained by Mathias Soeken via EMail.  Thus
also make sure that you include in any derived work a disclaimer how these
benchmarks were derived and that in particularly the original authors of the
generator for the verilog benchmarks do not provide any kind of warranty for
the correctness of the derived AIGER files.
